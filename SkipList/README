Part 1. 

Implement the randomized Skip List data structure and analyze its performance.  
In particular, we proved probabalistic bounds on the height of the structure and the number of "skip forward" 
moves needed.   Design experiments to analyze how closely your structure meets the theoretical performance.  

Part 2. 

Analyze the performance of the Skip List as a concurrent data structure.   For this part of the project, 
implement a Red-Black Tree structure and compare it to the Skip List as a concurrent data structure.   
In particular, compare the number of nodes that need to be "locked" when inserts/deletes are performed.

Q: How should we measure complexity?

-For the height of the skip list,  just count the number of levels (lists)
-For the "skip forward" and "drop down" moves, count the number of actual moves made (not just a 
 timing analysis)
-For the number of nodes locked, when a node is locked you should assume that none of the nodes
 beyond it are reachable and hence they too are locked
